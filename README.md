The application is made with Android Studio and Written in Java.
It uses a backend written in php using the Laravel framework and mysql database.
Clients search for freelancers using filters and send requests through the API. 
The freelancers evaluate the request and can accept or reject requests.
Their response is then relayed to the client who is able to track the progress of their project as the freelancer updates it on their side. 
Postman was also used to test the API requests and view the responses in various formats.

## How it works
> We have 2 users of the application:
> 1. Freelancer-Uploads the   services he/she offers e.g Plumber.
> 2. Client-Seeking for a service e.g Repair my pipe.

> The application aims to connect a client to a freelancer.
> The client can access the freelancers contacts from the app and approach the freelancer using other means or can send a request via the application to the freelancer.
